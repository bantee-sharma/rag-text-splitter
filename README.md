# rag-text-splitter
 In this repo, I explored text splitting techniques to process large documents effectively for downstream tasks like question answering, summarization, or semantic search. Here's what I learned and what the key files contribute:


✅ Purpose of the Repo
To experiment with text splitting strategies using Python and LangChain-style logic, helping to chunk long documents into manageable pieces while preserving semantic meaning.

🗂️ Key Files & What I Learned
length_based.py
🔹 Implements Length-based Splitter, which breaks text into chunks based on character or token length.
🔹 Helps in handling context limits of LLMs.
